# ExampleLongHandArrayFlattener

Example code to flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers (w/out language-provided array flatteners like Ruby's Array#flatten).

PURPOSE:

Write some code, that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers.
e.g. [[1,2,[3]],4] -> [1,2,3,4]. 

Your solution should be a link to a gist on gist.github.com with your implementation.

When writing this code, you can use any language you're comfortable with. The code must be well tested and documented.
Please include unit tests and any documentation you feel is necessary. In general, treat the quality of the code as
if it was ready to ship to production.

Try to avoid using language defined methods like Ruby's Array#flatten.

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
